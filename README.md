MonomeSerial
============

Communicate with a monome via the serial port. Receive button events, illuminate lights, build the grid interface of your dreams.

Run the example like so:

  lein repl test/example.clj

It will do a little intro sequence, and then you can press buttons to see them
light-up.  Pressing (0, 0), or the top left when the cord is facing away from
you, will exit the example.
